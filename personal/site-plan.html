        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this website is to give me an opportunity to learn and
            grow as a student, and a programmer. This is a place where I can
            practice what I have learned and apply it directly. Over time I hope to
            keep expanding both my knowledge and this webpage and be able to display
            all that I had learned through this course.</p>
        <!-- change this -->

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>This webpage is for anyone who wants to see me progress and learn, as
            well as to check on my progress. I also plan on using this sight to show off some of
            the things I have created, as well as show of some cool creations made by others.
            So if you enjoy Legos and models, this might just be the website for you!</p>
