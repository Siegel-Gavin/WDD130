      <h1>Gavin "Jay" Siegel</h1>
      <p>Hey, I'm Gavin. I live in Rexburg but grew up in North Carolina.</p>
      <p>
        I'm currently studying Information Technology and I'm on my
        senior year just looking to finish off school soon.
        There really isn't much to me, I'm married, have a German Shephard who's
        name is Indiana Bones. I work full time and I enjoy video games and movies. When I do get free time I 
        like assembling and painting models as a side-hobby as well as building stuff with Legos. I like making things
        so I decidided to try my luck with web-pages.
